## About

### Why did I make this project?
I built this project to display a working knowledge of how to integrate node, mongo, mongoose, express and postman.

### What makes this app standout?
This project doesn't stand out tbh. bootcamp week 18 assignments for the social network api probably are all pretty much the same. I do have a seed generator, which generates a object with a username and email and another object for a quote and username.

## Installation
```npm i```

## Usage

`npm run seed`
`npm start`

## Contribution
email me.

## Testing
```none```
